Abstract
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have seen increased adoption due to recent advancements in electronic and computer technologies. WSNs are frequently employed in critical applications, such as military operations, where security is paramount. However, ensuring security in WSNs is more challenging compared to other wireless networks like ad-hoc LANs and cellular networks. These challenges stem from the limited capabilities of sensor node hardware and the complex environments in which they are deployed.

This project aims to address these security concerns by proposing a method to reduce the Path Compromising Ratio (PCR) in WSNs. We present an algorithm that calculates the vulnerabilities of individual sensor nodes by analyzing factors such as gradient attack distribution and neighboring node distribution within the network. Using this algorithm, it becomes easier to identify the most vulnerable nodes, thereby strengthening the network's defense against adversaries.

Additionally, we introduce a key management scheme in which the key pools assigned to sensor nodes are hashed. This hashing technique reduces the number of compromised links, weakening the adversarial attack model in comparison to a basic scheme where no hashing is applied.
